* Diskin's paper on symmetric delta lenses proposed a neat trip-and-a-half law
  (though I wouldn't call it a round-trip-and-a-half law!); an analog for edit
  lenses would be roughly:

  dputr(a,s) = (b,s')
  dputl(b,s) = (a',s'')
  ---------------------
  dputr(a',s) = (b,s''')

  (note that the behavior on states is essentially completely unconstrained)
  I wonder how many of our edit lenses conform to this law.
