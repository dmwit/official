notes I took during the committee commentary afterwards:
- could use some more early setup/motivation, especially exploration of related approaches and why they don't work well -- especially good if it can be used as motivation for design decisions as they arise
- Nate wants to see some discussion about C-lenses and the Johnson/Rosebrugh work -- he has some ideas about how to compare, so talk to him about it
- cite our own papers early on, and make it clear that this work is based on them
- when citing other work, name the folks who worked on it
- the abstract ended on a real downer -- spin it better. an implementation is a contribution, so sell it as one
- in the implementation chapter, focus more on what was accomplished; compare to other Haskell lens libraries; and give some explanations of Haskell syntax and introductory material for people who aren't familiar with Haskell (e.g. dropping CT into Haskell wholesale is no big deal for Haskell folks, but could be very surprising to others)
- the problems identified by an implementation are themselves contributions
- could do better signposting by introducing constraint maintainers at the beginning of chapter 2, and explaining what pieces are unsatisfactory that we plan on improving on
- Stephanie says: diving into CT so heavily was a shock after chapter 1; so motivate the use of CT early on, maybe even in the introduction
- don't make the implementation come across as a negative -- portray it is a contribution (can't remember who said it but: current presentation is 30% contribution/70% problems, and that's backwards; should be 70% talking about how it's a contribution/30% describing problems)

Steve's notes on committee requests [with my commentary in brackets]:
- more related work
    - Mike Johnson's line of work
    - BX workshop (talk to Nate)
- a bit more motivation about choices in design
    - comparison to alternatives (talk to Nate)
- chapter 1: fore-shadow category [theory]
    - sign posting [I suppose this means between chapters]
- Acknowledgements [sic]
    - papers (funding?) [I think the "papers" part means to say which papers the dissertation is based on]
    - Researcher names (not citations)
- chapter 4 - implementation
    - don't end the abstract on a downer
    - identify the next challenge
    - the many libraries are a contribution
    - Haskell [probably this is a request to give more explanation about the language]

Comments from Steve's copy of the dissertation:
questions on the front page:
    - After all your thinking about this -- how important is symmetry? i.e. is making the assumption that one repository is the 'master' all that bad?
    - Structured editors / dealing with unstructured data; To what extent does structure in the source/target make this problem easier/harder? edits have more semantic content
    - What was the most interesting thing you learned when implementing the Haskell library + example.
    - Symmetric monoidal closed? [Is there a meaningful linear implication space in the category of lenses?]
    - \delta(\mu X. T) ~> recursive edits; What goes wrong here?
    - Do edits really need to form a monoid? What if they need context?
    - There and back again... =) [Has anybody used this most excellent title yet?]
Acknowledgments: Make sure you clearly lay out the papers that this work is based on...
1.0 p001 "in synch": sync or synch?
1.0 p002 Why isn't 'asymmetric lenses' in this list?
         "Table 1.1 shows how other approaches stack up" what does "other" mean? other than asymmetric lenses, or what?
1.6 p014 Say what papers this document is based on
2.3 p030 "This transformation... respects much of the structure available in our category." Is this the first explicit mention that you're building a category?
2.4 p041 Is LENS symmetric monoidal closed? i.e. does it admit -o? i.e. is it a model of linear logic?
3.0 p080 A bit more high-level sign-posting would be nice. -- remind us what an 'edit' and 'edit lens' are
    p082 "As argued in [6], answers to these questions" citations /= nouns
    p084 "The solution is to store a small list, called a complement," maybe refer to the earlier chapter?
3.4 p132 "In the following, we slightly deviate from... [2]" [could mean not to use a citation as a noun, or to name the person we're citing, I'm not sure]
5.1 p164 "They arrive at a slightly different point" who?
6.0 p180 [In Table 6.1, specifically in the caption, green and red backgrounds are] hard to distinguish in black + white
A.3 p188 How was this code formatted? Listings or lhs2tex? It's not very 'pretty'
         the "\" lambda and ">>=" bind are in strangely incongruous fonts

Comments from Stephanie's copy of the dissertation:
Acknowledgements: NSF or other funding agency?
Abstract: [The last sentence is marked. Perhaps this is to reiterate the complaint from elsewhere that it should be reworked to be more positive.]
1.2 p004 after the footnote: =) could do more [no idea what this is supposed to mean]
    p005 "The lower lens to convert a possibly-upper-case letter" to convert -> converts
1.5 p013 "devotion to retaining a rich syntax---that is, a large collection" is this [syntax] the right word?
         "relaxing the restriction that a single run" run -> pass?
1.6 p015 references to related publications?
1.7 p016 Add a warning about the category theory? [this is where the comment appears, but it doesn't seem to be implying that this is where the warning should go]
2.1 p017 "and was adapted to lenses in [6]" don't use citations as nouns
2.2 p024 why do we care about lens equivalence?
2.3 p029 "Thus symmetric lenses form a category... composition is [k]; [l] = [k; l]." [This sentence is marked, but there's no indication of why.]
2.3 p034 where is this defn from? [Definition 2.3.16 of isomorphism of categories]
2.4 p041 "algebraically quite well behaved" This means, has lots of laws?
         Can you compare categorical product + tensor product more? Is there intuition why the former doesn't make sense? Or relate tensor product to other constructs?
2.5 p044 "these constructions are even farther away from being categorical sums than what we saw with products." why?
         "which we called retentive and forgetful in \S2.1" ? [the words "retentive and forgetful" are circled]
2.8 p072 "definitions from earlier in this paper" [the word "paper" is circled, presumably to suggest that we should write "dissertation" or "document" or just refer to a section or something]
3.1 p080 Reprise the motivation; this dives into things pretty fast
3.2 p085 "For a simple example of (a), ... (unless the first is the unit):" Maybe is a monoid [no indication that this is supposed to correspond to a change -- probably just a comment summarizing this chunk of text.]
3.4 p133 [near Definition 3.4.4 of container edits] How do we know that these are the right edits? (Similarly for lists)
3.5 p140 "The edit languages... were all freely generated." concrete example of edits with laws?
4.1 p151 "it is not clear that avoiding dependent types entirely was beneficial." say what you mean more plainly. =)
4.3 p155 "\SA" Appendix
         This chapter is really hard to follow.
5.0 p163 "The two variants of delta lenses... causing performance problems." why perf is not checked [may not be asking for a change]
         [near Table 5.1] edit lenses should be in this table
    p164 who? it's nice to actually use names
         "different point in the design space compared to us" who is "us"?
5.2 p172 "They consider, as we do" who is they?
5.4 p177 "addresses this niche" is it really a niche?
6.0 p179 "Related approaches to this problem are summarized..."
   -p180 "...a key piece of syntax." isn't this what the last chapter was about?
    p180 [Table 6.1] group based = [algebraic]?
         [Table 6.1] what is the connection with Table 5.1
A.3 p186 lhs2tex would typeset it better
A.14p200 "-- TODO: implement in terms of functions like length/filter" [this code is circled; no comment is attached, but probably it's best to just delete that line]
Bibliography: [15] and [16] (Combinators for bi-directional tree transformations) seem to be duplicates

Comments from Nate's copy of the dissertation:
Abstract: "Finally, a prototype... representation of edits." Kind of a downer!
1.1 p003 "in terms of constraints on l.put" and create
1.2 p008 "Because of this... cannot be internally communicated between lens components." minor, but not true of matching lenses
1.3 p009 "One could continue by designing a 'bi-bidirectional' language" =)
1.4 p012 "CVS, SVN" Google Wave?
1.5 p013 "Whether one prioritizes... in parallel with the semantics." but you did it semantically by showing LENS does not have products
1.7 p015 "and C for complement sets" first use of "complements"
    p016 [the empty space in the last row, first column of Table 1.2 describing arrow types is circled] ?
2.1 p023 [Put-Put Laws] context?
2.2 p025 motivate ≈ vs. ≡??
2.4 p038 "Building a categorical product from a tensor product is not the most familiar presentation." ?
2.6 p061 "\exists suitable w" ? w ∉ this defn?
2.8 p076 "We suspect there might be an asymmetric fold... but have not explored this carefully." the has this, I think [the words aren't really legible, might be worth asking what this means]
3.1 p080 [first sentence is marked, but no indication what the mark means]
    p084 "In general... also small compared to the size of the repositories." is this claim true?
3.2 p089 [Definition 3.2.10 of lens equivalence] same dy? I see, yes. [probably not intended to indicate a place to change something]
3.3 p095 "This is a good lens" inf. ["good lens" is underlined; probably stands for "informal"]
3.3 p120 what is the case analysis in? Ah, I see. Would be clearer to label them with intuitive names.
3.4 p134 ✓
3.5 p142 ✓
3.6 p149 can differ emit non-total lenses [probably means to ask edits]
4.3 p155 "One can view this as giving a way to overload the names dputr and dputl" ["dputr" and "dputl" are circled, but no indication why -- perhaps because they are not typeset in typewriter font]
5.5 p178 put first? expand.
6.1 p183 "correctness of the lens depends... anticipate that this function will be simple" !
Bibliography: [15] and [16] (Combinators for bi-directional tree transformations) seem to be duplicates
an attempt at deciphering things jotted on the final page:
- proofread [or maybe protocol]: extend X?
- inductive: <assoc/swap> etc. [could be a reference to the question he asked afterwards about swapping data across tuples]
- symm \delta/equiv
[the following are in a different ink, so perhaps the above are jotted during the talk and the below while reading or something like that]
- why Meertens has no composition
- Diskin edit p. 170
- M types. / containers
- weight iterators
- spans p. 77
- edit lens equivalence p. 89
- Johnson: opfibrations / uniqueness vs. edit lens.
- copy + containers p. 134?
- differ total?
