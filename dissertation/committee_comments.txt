- could use some more early setup/motivation, especially exploration of related approaches and why they don't work well -- especially good if it can be used as motivation for design decisions as they arise
- could do better signposting by introducing constraint maintainers at the beginning of chapter 2, and explaining what pieces are unsatisfactory that we plan on improving on
    SAZ 3.1 p080 A bit more high-level sign-posting would be nice. -- remind us what an 'edit' and 'edit lens' are
    SCW 3.1 p080 Reprise the motivation; this dives into things pretty fast
- in the implementation chapter, focus more on what was accomplished; compare to other Haskell lens libraries; and give some explanations of Haskell syntax and introductory material for people who aren't familiar with Haskell (e.g. dropping CT into Haskell wholesale is no big deal for Haskell folks, but could be very surprising to others)
    - the problems identified by an implementation are themselves contributions
    - don't make the implementation come across as a negative -- portray it is a contribution (can't remember who said it but: current presentation is 30% contribution/70% problems, and that's backwards; should be 70% talking about how it's a contribution/30% describing problems)
    - identify the next challenge
    - the many libraries are a contribution
    - Haskell [probably this is a request to give more explanation about the language]
    SCW 4.3 p155 This chapter is really hard to follow.
- more related work: BX workshop (talk to Nate)

questions on the front page of Steve's copy:
    - After all your thinking about this -- how important is symmetry? i.e. is making the assumption that one repository is the 'master' all that bad?
    - Structured editors / dealing with unstructured data; To what extent does structure in the source/target make this problem easier/harder? edits have more semantic content
    - What was the most interesting thing you learned when implementing the Haskell library + example.
    - Symmetric monoidal closed? [Is there a meaningful linear implication space in the category of lenses?]
    - \delta(\mu X. T) ~> recursive edits; What goes wrong here?
    - Do edits really need to form a monoid? What if they need context?
    - There and back again... =) [Has anybody used this most excellent title yet?]
SAZ 2.4 p041 Is LENS symmetric monoidal closed? i.e. does it admit -o? i.e. is it a model of linear logic?
SCW 1.2 p004 after the footnote: =) could do more [no idea what this is supposed to mean]
SCW 2.3 p029 "Thus symmetric lenses form a category... composition is [k]; [l] = [k; l]." [This sentence is marked, but there's no indication of why.]
SCW 3.2 p085 "For a simple example of (a), ... (unless the first is the unit):" Maybe is a monoid [no indication that this is supposed to correspond to a change -- probably just a comment summarizing this chunk of text.]
SCW 5.0 p163 "The two variants of delta lenses... causing performance problems." why perf is not checked [may not be asking for a change]
JNF 1.3 p009 "One could continue by designing a 'bi-bidirectional' language" =)
JNF 3.1 p080 [first sentence is marked, but no indication what the mark means]
JNF 3.2 p089 [Definition 3.2.10 of lens equivalence] same dy? I see, yes. [probably not intended to indicate a place to change something]

JNF 3.5 p142 ✓
JNF 4.3 p155 "One can view this as giving a way to overload the names dputr and dputl" ["dputr" and "dputl" are circled, but no indication why -- perhaps because they are not typeset in typewriter font]
JNF 6.1 p183 "correctness of the lens depends... anticipate that this function will be simple" !
an attempt at deciphering things jotted on the final page of Nate's copy:
