\label{sec:algebraic}
% Perdita's explorations figuring out what properties transformations have

% (but totally uninterested in syntax)
There is a line of work on algebraic foundations for delta lenses that
arrives at a model very similar to the edit lens framework described
above~\cite{stevens2008tat}. They consider, as we do, edit monoids together
with edit translation homomorphisms and (total) edit application actions.
One significant difference is that they consider generalizing asymmetric
rather than symmetric lenses, adopting correspondingly modified behavioral
laws. In particular, in their setting, a delta lens is a \emph{lens-like
split short exact sequence}. Below we discuss each of these restrictions in
right-to-left order.

\begin{definition}
    The \emph{kernel} of a monoid homomorphism $f$, denoted $\ker(f)$, is
    the preimage of $\ONE$:
    \[\ker(f) = \{x \mid f(x) = \ONE\}\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    An \emph{exact sequence} is a sequence $\blist f_1 \clist f_n \elist$ of
    monoid homomorphisms with compatible domains and codomains, that is,
    \begin{diagram}
        \path
            node                      (0)    {$X_0$}
            node[right=2.5em of 0]    (1)    {$X_1$}
            node[right=2.5em of 1]    (2)    {$X_2$}
            node[right=2.5em of 2]    (dots) {$\cdots$}
            node[right=2.5em of dots] (n2)   {$X_{n-2}$}
            node[right=2.5em of n2]   (n1)   {$X_{n-1}$}
            node[right=2.5em of n1]   (n0)   {$X_n$}
            (0)    edge[->] node[above] {$f_1$}     (1)
            (1)    edge[->] node[above] {$f_2$}     (2)
            (2)    edge[->] node[above] {$f_3$}     (dots)
            (dots) edge[->] node[above] {$f_{n-2}$} (n2)
            (n2)   edge[->] node[above] {$f_{n-2}$} (n1)
            (n1)   edge[->] node[above] {$f_n$}     (n0)
        ;
    \end{diagram}
    and such that $\im(f_i)=\ker(f_{i+1})$ for each $i$.
\end{definition}

\section{Matching lenses}
\label{sec:matching}
% defining good alignment heuristics along with your lens
% decouples alignment discovery from lens operation
% does give concrete operations for discovering alignments; but is
% significantly more complex; can only handle containers with a single kind
% of data inside (e.g. could give good treatment to either the [a] or the
% [b] in a ([a], [b]))

\section{Hole-based delta lenses}
\label{sec:holes}
% lenses that operate on full data structures with node
% creation/deletion/modification ``holes'' in them -- tackles alignment
% problems, but not size or symmetry
%
% some text below that we can also scan for ideas about what to write here

\section{Fibrations}
\label{sec:fibrations}
% Johnson+Rosebrugh's work on sketch-based data modeling; see FogBugz for a
% list of resources to consult when it comes time to write this section
%
% still digesting, but it seems they have a notion of edit but that it
% doesn't help with alignment (?) and that they don't really propose much in
% the way of syntax -- they only give a way to check if a particular
% hand-constructed transformation is allowed

\section{Constraint maintainers}
\label{sec:constraint-maintainers}
% symmetric, but we improve in many ways
%
% some text below that we can also scan for ideas about what to write here

% In case of time crunch, may be able to drop this section!

\subsection{Graph transformations}
\label{sec:other-related-work:graph}
% BiG-lab's stuff -- check if they make any attempt at symmetry or edits

\subsection{Triple graph grammars}
\label{sec:other-related-work:triple}
% gives an attempt at parsing graphs; some of the tools are symmetric, and
% may be in use, but need to review a bit before knowing what to say here

\subsection{Incremental XML transformations}
\label{sec:other-related-work:xml}
% sort of tangentially related; lots of stuff is based on tree transducers;
% very interested in good models for edits and edit transformations so
% perhaps we have something to teach them there

% dump from our delta lenses paper {{{
%
%The most closely related attempt at developing a theory of update
%propagation is \cite{Diskin-Delta11} by Diskin et al. Their starting
%point is the observation (also discussed in \cite{Matching10}) that discovery of
%edits should be decoupled from their propagation. They thus propose a
%formalism, \emph{sd-lenses}, for the propagation of edits across
%synchronized data structures, bearing some similarities with our
%edit lenses. The replicas, which we model as modules, are there modeled
%as categories (presented as reflexive graphs)\iffull, as we discussed in 
%\S \ref{cats}\fi. Thus, for any two states $x,x'$ there is a set of
%edits $X(x,x')$. An sd-lens then comprises two reflexive graphs $X,Y$
%and for any $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$ a set $C(x,y)$ of
%``correspondences'' which roughly correspond to our
%complements. Forward and backward operations similar to our $\dputl$ and
%$\dputr$ then complete the picture. No concrete
%examples are given of sd-lenses, no composition, no notion of equivalence, and
%no combinators for constructing sd-lenses; the focus of the paper is
%rather on the discovery of suitable axioms, such as invertibility and
%undoability of edits, and a 
%generalization of {\em hippocraticness} in the sense of
%Stevens~\cite{Stevens07}. They also develop a comparison 
%with the state-based framework (cf.\ \S \ref{stateb} above). In
%our opinion, the separation of edits and correspondences according to
%the states that they apply to or relate has two important
%disadvantages.  First, in our examples, it is often the case that one
%and the same edit applies to more than one state and can be
%meaningfully propagated (and more compactly represented) as such. For example, while many of the
%container edits tend to only work for a particular shape, they are
%completely polymorphic in the contents of the container. Second, the
%fact that state sets are already categories suggests 
%that a category of sd-lenses would be
%2-categorical in flavor, entailing extra technical difficulties such as
%coherence conditions.

%%%   comparison, since it's one of the main points of their paper.
%%%   \item They don't handle $\missing$ (a small point)
%%%   \item They don't define any combinators, just the semantic space itself (a
%%%   larger point, and related) 
%%%   \item Their Definition 19 and Theorem 5 relate their delta-lenses to our

%%%   ``trivial module'' correspond to their ``simple graph''?), but in any case
%%%   our result is stronger because it goes both directions.  (Their

%There is a large literature on lenses and related approaches to
%propagating updates between connected structures.  We discuss only the most
%closely related work here; good general surveys of the area can be found
%in~\cite{FosterThesis,DBLP:conf/icmt/CzarneckiFHLST09}.  Connections to the
%literature on {\em view update} in databases are surveyed
%in~\cite{Focal2005-shortcite}. \iffull A short version of this paper is available
%in~\cite{HofmannPierceWagner10}.\fi
%
%The first symmetric approach to update propagation was proposed by
%Meer\-tens~\cite{Meertens98} and followed up \iffull in the context of
%model-driven design \fi by Stevens~\cite{Stevens07},
%Diskin~\cite{DBLP:conf/models/Diskin08}, and Xiong, et
%al~\cite{xiong2009supporting}.
%%
%Meertens suggests modeling synchronization between two sets
%$X$ and $Y$ by a {\em consistency relation} $R\subseteq
%X\times Y$ and two {\em consistency maintainers}
%$\triangleleft: X\times Y\rightarrow X$ and $\triangleright: X\times Y
%\rightarrow Y$ such that $(x\triangleleft y) \relR y$ and
%$x \relR (x\triangleright y)$ always hold, and such that $x \relR y$ implies
%$x \triangleleft y = x$ and $x \triangleright y = y$.
%
%The main advantage of symmetric lenses over consistency maintainers is
%their closure under composition. Indeed, all of the aforementioned
%authors note that, in general, consistency maintainers do not compose
%and view this as a drawback.
%%
%Suppose that we have relations $R\subseteq X\times Y$ and
%$R'\subseteq Y\times Z$ maintained by $\triangleright,\triangleleft$
%and $\triangleright', \triangleleft'$, resp. If we want to construct a
%maintainer for the composition $R;R'$, we face the problem that, given
%$x\in X$ and $z\in Z$, there is no canonical way of coming up with a
%$y\in Y$ that will allow us to use either of the existing maintainer
%functions. Concretely, Meertens gives the following counterexample.
%Let $X$ be the set of nonempty context free grammars over some alphabet, and let
%$Y$ be the set of words over that same alphabet. Let $R\subseteq
%X\times Y$ be given by $G \relR x\iff x\in L(G)$. It is easy to define
%computable maintainer functions making this relation a constraint
%maintainer. Composing this relation with its opposite yields an 
%undecidable relation (namely, whether the intersection of two context-free
%grammars is nonempty), so there cannot be computable maintainer functions.
%
%We can transform any constraint maintainer into a  symmetric lens as
%follows: take the relation $R$ itself (viewed as a set of pairs) as
%the complement, and define $\putl(x',(x,y))=(x'\triangleright
%y,(x',x'\triangleright y))$ and similarly 
%for $\putr$. If we compose such a symmetric lens with its opposite
%we obtain $R\times R\op$ as the complement and, for example,
%$\putr(x',((x_1,y_1),(y_2,x_2))) = 
%(x_2\triangleleft(x'\triangleright y_1), ((x',x'\triangleright
%y_1),(x'\triangleright y_1,x_2\triangleleft(x'\triangleright y_1))))$. 
%%
%For Meertens' counterexample, we would have complements of the form
%$((G_1,w_1),(w_2,G_2))$, with $w_1\in L(G_1)$
%and $w_2\in L(G_2)$; ``$\putr$''-ing a new grammar
%$G_1'$ through the composed lens yields the complement
%$((G_1',w_1'),(w_1',G_2'))$, where $w_1'$ is $w_1$ if $w_1\in L(G_1)$ and
%some default otherwise, and where $G_2'=G_2$ if $w_1'\in L(G_2)$ and
%$S{\rightarrow}w_1'$ (where $S$ is the start state) otherwise. We observe
%that there is a property of lenses analogous to Meertens' requirement that
%$x \relR y$ implies $x \triangleleft y = x$. This property is not
%necessarily preserved by composition, and in particular the lens described
%above for synchronizing languages does not have it.
%%
%Meertens recommends using a {\em chain} of consistency maintainers in such a
%situation to achieve a similar effect; however, the properties of such
%chains have not been explored.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%For asymmetric lenses, a number of alternative \iffull choices of behavioral
%\fi
%laws 
%have been explored.  Some of these are \iffull strictly \fi weaker than ours; for
%example, a number of papers from a community of researchers based in Tokyo
%replace the \rn{PutGet} law with a somewhat looser \rn{PutGetPut} law,
%permitting a broader range of useful behaviors for lenses that duplicate
%information.  It would be interesting to see what kind of categorical
%structures arise from these choices.  The proposal by Matsuda et
%al.~\cite{matsuda2007btb} is particularly interesting because it also employs
%the idea of complements.  Conversely, stronger laws can be imagined, such as
%the \rn{PutPut} law discussed by Foster et
%al.~\cite{Focal2005-shortcite}\iffull{} and the more refined variants
%in~\cite{updatable-security-views}\fi\iflater\finish{Say something more
%  about this?}\fi.
%
%A different foundation for defining lenses by recursion was explored by
%Foster et al.~\cite{Focal2005-shortcite}, using standard tools from domain
%theory to define monotonicity and continuity for lens combinators
%parametrized on other lenses.  The main drawback of this approach is that
%the required (manual) proofs that such recursive lenses are total tend to be
%somewhat intricate.  By contrast, we expect that our initial-algebra
%approach can be equipped with automatic proofs of totality (that is, choices
%of the weight function $w$) in many cases of interest.
