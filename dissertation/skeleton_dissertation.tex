\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

This dissertation is the product of dozens of supportive, encouraging,
inspiring people. The entire lens team was wonderful to me: Benjamin Pierce,
whose long vision and habit of asking the question that gets straight to the
pain point have driven my research towards the important, difficult problems
time and time again; Martin Hofmann, who has been a source of unending
enthusiasm and deep insight; Nate Foster, who is to blame for my obsession
with lenses in the first place and who has always been ready to discuss
their finer points with me; and the remainder of my committee, Steve
Zdancewic, Stephanie Weirich, and Rajeev Alur, who have offered significant
guidance and technical perspective throughout my efforts.

I have had immeasurable support of a different kind from my family: my wife,
Nicole, who has provided loving, steadfast support and optimism and who has
ever been a source of joy and surprise; my father, Rich, whose focus on the
broader perspective has informed much of my writing, who has shared with me
his love of the systematic, and who provided many insightful comments on
drafts of this dissertation; my mother, Martha, who has always encouraged me
and whose faith in me has been like bedrock; my godfather, Dave Gunderson,
who has always been a storyteller and so enlivened many nights; and my
siblings, David, Jonathan, and Rebekah, with whom I have shared many
triumphs and defeats.

William K. Lamb brought me back from the brink of despair; without him, this
dissertation certainly would not exist and maybe neither would I.
Officemates Peter-Michael Osera, Vilhelm Sj\"oberg, and Brent Yorgey have
always been ready for some brick-walling, grungy \TeX\ and shell hacking,
in-jokes, or any of the other camaraderie that contributes to a successful
day. This comes in part, no doubt, from the shared attitude of the entire
Penn PL Club, which has fostered a warm and welcoming place to work. I have
been blessed to have an environment---family, childhood friends, teachers,
professors, classmates, colleagues---that has lifelong fostered wonder and
the joy of exploration.

\noindent
{\em Lenses} are bidirectional transformations between pairs of connected
structures capable of translating an edit on one structure into an edit on
the other. Most of the extensive existing work on lenses has focused on the
special case of {\em asymmetric lenses}, where one structures is taken as
primary and the other is thought of as a projection or view. Some symmetric
variants exist, where each structure contains information not present in the
other, but these all lack the basic operation of {\em composition}.
Additionally, existing accounts do not {\em represent} edits carefully,
making incremental operation difficult or producing unsatisfactory
synchronization candidates. We present a new symmetric formulation which
works with descriptions of changes to structures, rather than with the
structures themselves. We construct a semantic space of {\em edit lenses}
between ``editable structures''---monoids of edits with a partial monoid
action for applying edits---with natural laws governing their behavior. We
present generalizations of a number of known constructions on asymmetric
lenses and settle some longstanding questions about their properties---in
particular, we prove the existence of (symmetric monoidal) tensor products
and sums and the {\em non-}existence of full categorical products and sums
in a category of lenses. Universal algebra shows how to build {\em iterator
lenses} for structured data such as lists and trees, yielding lenses for
operations like mapping, filtering, and concatenation from first principles.
More generally, we provide mapping combinators based on the theory of {\em
containers}~\cite{1195941}. Finally, a prototype implementation suggests
that the core theory is sound but does not adequately address the
translation between user gestures and the internal representation of edits.
