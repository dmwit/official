This dissertation is the product of dozens of supportive, encouraging,
inspiring people. The entire extended lens team was wonderful to me:
Benjamin Pierce, whose long vision and habit of asking the question that
gets straight to the pain points have driven my research towards the
important, difficult problems time and time again; Martin Hofmann, who has
been a source of unending enthusiasm and deep insight; Nate Foster, who is
to blame for my obsession with lenses in the first place and who has always
been ready to discuss their finer points with me; and Steve Zdancewic and
Stephanie Weirich, who have offered significant guidance and technical
perspective throughout my efforts. William Lamb brought me back from the
brink of despair; without him, this dissertation certainly would not exist
and maybe neither would I. My family: my wife, Nicole, who has provided
loving, steadfast support and who has ever been a source of joy and
surprise; my father, Rich, who has always focused on the broader
perspective, and who has shared with me his love of the systematic; my
mother, Martha, who has always encouraged me and whose faith in me has been
like bedrock; and my siblings, David, Jonathan, and Rebekah, with whom I
have shared many triumphs and defeats. My classmates, Peter-Michael Osera,
Brent Yorgey, and Vilhelm Sj\"oberg, have always been ready for some
camaraderie, brick-walling, \TeX\ hacking, or any of the other things that
contribute to a successful day. This comes, no doubt, from the shared
attitude of the entire UPenn programming languages group, which has fostered
a warm and welcoming place to work. I have been blessed to have an
environment---family, childhood friends, teachers, professors, classmates,
colleagues---that has always fostered wonder and the joy of exploration.

\noindent
{\em Lenses} are bidirectional transformations between pairs of connected
structures capable of translating an edit on one structure into an edit on
the other. Most of the extensive existing work on lenses has focused on the
special case of {\em asymmetric lenses}, where one structures is taken as
primary and the other is thought of as a projection or view. Some symmetric
variants exist, where each structure contains information not present in the
other, but these all lack the basic operation of {\em composition}.
Additionally, existing accounts do not {\em represent} edits carefully,
making incremental operation difficult or producing unsatisfactory
synchronization candidates. We present a new symmetric formulation which
works with descriptions of changes to structures, rather than with the
structures themselves. We construct a semantic space of {\em edit lenses}
between ``editable structures''---monoids of edits with a partial monoid
action for applying edits---with natural laws governing their behavior. We
present generalizations of a number of known constructions on asymmetric
lenses and settle some longstanding questions about their properties---in
particular, we prove the existence of (symmetric monoidal) tensor products
and sums and the {\em non-}existence of full categorical products and sums
in a category of lenses. Universal algebra shows how to build {\em iterator
lenses} for structured data such as lists and trees, yielding lenses for
operations like mapping, filtering, and concatenation from first principles.
More generally, we provide mapping combinators based on the theory of {\em
containers}~\cite{1195941}. Finally, a prototype implementation suggests
that the core theory is sound but does not adequately address the
translation between user gestures and the internal representation of edits.
