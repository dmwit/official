\abstract{We consider a simple set of edit operations for unordered,
  edge-labeled trees, called {\em information trees} by Dal Zilio {\em et
  al}~\cite{DalzilioS:POPL04}.  We define {\em tree languages} using the
  {\em sheaves automata} from \cite{Foster:FTL} which in turn are based on
  \cite{DalzilioS:POPL04} and provide an algorithm for deciding whether a
  complex edit preserves membership in a tree language. This allows us to
  view sheaves automata and subsets of tree edits as {\em edit languages} in
  the sense of~\cite{HofmannPierceWagner12}. They can then be used to
  instantiate the framework of {\em edit lenses} between such languages and
  model concrete examples such as synchronisation between different file
  systems or address directories.}
