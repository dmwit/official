\begin{itemize}
    \item intro: name two projects, quick overview, maybe table of contents
    \item symmetric edit lenses for trees
        \begin{itemize}
            \item what's known
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item symmetric vs. asymmetric
                    \item stateful vs. delta vs. edit
                    \item strings vs. trees
                \end{itemize}
            \item why it's worth knowing more
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item model transformation
                    \item syntax transformations like hiding code, making
                        documentation
                    \item maybe talk about machine translation, and
                        translating updated texts? a bit up in the air,
                        really, whether I want to get into that
                \end{itemize}
            \item what's hard/what I'll work on
        \end{itemize}
    \item do something good with datalog
        \begin{itemize}
            \item what's known
            \item why it's worth knowing more
            \item what's hard/what I'll work on
        \end{itemize}
    \item concrete proposal timeline
    \item failure modes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I can't understand transducers, and that turns out to be
                important
            \item I can't figure out what to do about sums
            \item Datalog is harder than I thought
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
