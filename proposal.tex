\begin{itemize}
    \item intro: name two projects, quick overview, maybe table of contents
    \item symmetric edit lenses for trees
        \begin{itemize}
            \item what's known
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item symmetric vs. asymmetric
                    \item stateful vs. delta vs. edit
                    \item strings vs. trees
                    \item worth mentioning other stuff like quotient lenses,
                        relation lenses, dictionary lenses, matching lenses,
                        etc.? probably!
                \end{itemize}
            \item why it's worth knowing more
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item model transformation
                    \item syntax transformations like hiding code, making
                        documentation
                    \item maybe talk about machine translation, and
                        translating updated texts? a bit up in the air,
                        really, whether I want to get into that
                \end{itemize}
            \item what's hard/what I'll work on
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item defining a model of edits for trees is step one
                    \item current tree edits are mostly unconcerned with typing
                    \item really want to classify carefully when an edit
                        typechecks so that when we write lenses we know what
                        assuming a well-typed edit \emph{means}
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \item do something good with datalog
        \begin{itemize}
            \item what's known: measure language (baroque and ad-hoc)
            \item why it's worth knowing more: big companies want to make
                predictions about their sales and do \emph{planning}:
                figuring out what local (e.g. store-specific or
                month-specific or product-specific) goals to set to achieve
                global goals
            \item recursion and disjunction are hard, so must identify a
                fragment we can handle
        \end{itemize}
    \item concrete proposal timeline (TODO: actually break things down
        enough that I know how long to assign to each of these, but this
        concrete start doesn't seem awful)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item six months on Datalog
            \item six months on trees
            \item two months writing
        \end{itemize}
    \item failure modes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item I can't understand transducers, and that turns out to be
                important
            \item I can't figure out what to do about sums
            \item Datalog is harder than I thought
            \item dialogue with LogicBlox falters (though provided we learn enough
                about what they need before this happens, can still aim at
                getting some results)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
