Bidirectional situations are all around us: we synchronize bookmarks, keep
clones of our data on our mobile devices, edit collaboratively, use GUIs to
visualize and modify chunks of our data, and more. In these situations, we
must write programs that translate back and forth between two data sets
which potentially use different storage formats and sometimes even record
differing characteristics of the data. The framework of
lenses~\cite{FosterThesis} aids in the creation and maintenance of these
translations by allowing the programmer to write a single program which can
be interpreted as both a forward and backward translation.

The basic lens framework, however, makes some assumptions about how the
transformations they describe will be used:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item One data set is less informative than the other, and can be
        completely recreated just by examining the more informative data
        set.
    \item It is reasonable to transmit and traverse entire data sets.
    \item There are just two data sets being synchronized (or at least, if
        there are many data sets, they can reasonably be linked pairwise).
\end{enumerate}
For some decentralized applications, there are two data sets which share
some data, but which also each have their own unshared data; because there
is no master data set, assumption (1) is violated. For large data sets, it
is reasonable to hope that one could store and transmit small descriptions
of recent changes (e.g. transmitting a diff rather than an entire updated
file), which violates assumption (2). Finally, a variant of spreadsheets
(where formulas for computing cell values are made bidirectional) can be
understood as many data sets---one for each cell---with intricate webs of
connections between them, violating assumption (3).

We will describe the generalized lens frameworks of symmetric lenses, which
relax assumption (1), and edit lenses, which relax assumption (2). We
propose a novel lens framework based on local constraint propagation which
relaxes assumption (3).
