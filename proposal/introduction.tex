Bidirectional situations are all around us. We synchronize bookmarks, keep
clones of our data on our mobile devices, edit collaboratively, use GUIs to
visualize and modify chunks of our data, etc. So designing tools that
support the creation and maintenance of these transformations is important.

Lots of nice things have been done (e.g. the asymmetric state-based lens
model and its instantiation in Boomerang), but there are many niches where
we might want more targeted support. For decentralized applications, neither
repository is canonical and you want a way to deal with that. For big data,
you want small descriptions of changes. Some data structures aren't most
naturally represented as strings, but as trees, relations, grids, graphs, or
other structures instead.

My thesis will be an exploration of these issues and what can be done to
deal with them; the major unfinished work that I will be proposing is
grid-structured data.
