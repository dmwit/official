proposed as one tool to aid in the creation and maintenance of these

The lens framework attempts to address this problem by giving a language of
% TODO
% - don't talk about business applications, talk about spreadsheets

=== High priority ===

% - add to the last paragraph: have one paragraph on what will be in the

% TODO: Benjamin says: ``This chapter needs to open with some text about the

% to it.''

% TODO: Benjamin says: ``This intro is going to get some more polishing,

=== Unprioritized ===

% TODO: part of the point of this is that all that can be done without
% complements, and this point needs to be made somehow for the next section
% to make sense

% TODO: comments from Benjamin:
% A small suggestion is that you may want to explain stratification.
%
% A slightly bigger one is that if Tiresias is very close to your work you
% may want to explain it in more detail.
%
% An open ended one is that you may get questions at your defense about how
% sure you are that you've found all the work that's related.  But you can
% do some more literature search between now and then -- this seems fine for
% the document.

\section{Timeline}

=== If there's time: ===

% TODO: things we know that aren't discussed here:
% - all the lens operations needed to implement the transformations we
%   discussed here, plus some for containers
% - recursion (right?)
% - machinery needed to show these operations are ``well-behaved'' (in
%   particular, have categorical descriptions)
% - exploration of different choices for several operators that are still
%   ``well-behaved'', and their tradeoffs
% TODO: see spreadsheet_resources.txt in triple-threat repository
Lenses keep two similar pieces of data consistent; as either one evolves,

=== Probably not that useful: ===

% TODO: picture

% TODO: also, many (most?) of the constraint propagation systems are about
% making GUIs, which we aren't really that interested in primarily: the data
% we're munging is user-visible (perhaps this is a serious point to make!)

% TODO: how to remove the enormous space after each chapter heading?
% (seems the memoir class can do this; look into it if there's time to mess
% with such prettification)

=== Definitely not happening: ===

% TODO: finish this proof and replace the above sketch, maybe

% TODO: fill in the acknowledgments section
