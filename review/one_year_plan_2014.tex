I intend to graduate this year, so my efforts are focused on preparing a
dissertation document. I have already completed a significant portion of the
required technical writing on lens foundations and instantiations; my short
term plan involves compiling a literature review of related lens efforts as
well as research agendas related to bidirectional programming that are not
directly lens-based. There also remains a significant body of additional
expository writing needed to produce a coherent document. I expect the
process to continue for three to four months, during which time I will be in
close communication with my advisor and dissertation committee to ensure
that my efforts are prioritized appropriately.
