Abstract: The venerable "diff" tool taught the tech world a valuable lesson:
describing what it means to edit a document formally can be a valuable
exercise.  Since then, an ever-growing collection of tools -- including
revision control systems, database management systems, and text editors -- have
benefited from formal studies of edits and changes. We examine three of these
studies, examining which benefits we can adopt when designing edit-based
synchronizers.

In particular, we focus our attention on the problem of formalizing and
modeling edits to tree-based data structures. The first study provides a
theoretical backdrop, anchoring the discussion somewhat; the second boasts
simplicity as well as a tractable algorithm for computing an approximately
minimal edit; and the third allows for great expressiveness, but sacrifices the
tractability of some problems.
