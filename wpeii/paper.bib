    abstract = {{Abstract. Version control systems are essential for managing the distributed development of large software projects. We present a formal model for reasoning about version control. In particular, we give a general definition of patch. Patches abstract over the data on which they operate, making our framework equally suited for version control of everything from highly-structured XML files to blobs of bits. We model repositories as a multiset of patches. The mathematical definitions of patches and repositories enable us to reason about complicated issues such as conflicts and conflict resolution. 1}},

    comment = {This paper aims at providing a formal mathematical model of a version control system. The paper does not look at centralised versus distributed version control systems. The focus of the paper is to establish a formal notion of patches and repository. The model is based on file an different operations that can be performed on files such as creation, deletion, and modification. These operations are performed using patches. The model considers text-based files as well as binary files. It is assumed that the files are stored in a hierarchical folder structure. It must be noted that although this model presents o formalisation of some key concepts in version control systems, it is not a complete model as it largely ignores the notion of branching and merging, developers, amount of change, and other metrics related to changes in the repository.

The biggest contribution of this paper, in my opinion, is the aim at creating a formalised model to describe version control system. The need for such a model will grow as more and more version control systems are created, and as the research in this area progresses. },
